# Project 2: Instanews App

This is a one-page website that allows a user to filter 6 top news story categories via the New York Times API. 

I used the mobile-first approach and then optimized the website for 2 more screen sizes: 600px (a tablet version) and 1000px (a desktop version).

## Key points of HTML (things used and personal learnings):

* Used `<select>` field
*
